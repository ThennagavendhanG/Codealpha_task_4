Step 1: Install Snort



For Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems:

1.Update and install dependencies:



Bash:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install snort -y



2.Check the installed Snort version:



Bash:

snort -V



For CentOS/RHEL-based Systems:



Bash:

sudo yum install snort -y





Step 2: Configure Snort

1.Find your network interface:



Bash:

ip a  # Look for an active network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0)



2.Edit the Snort configuration file:



Bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf



Set HOME_NET to match your network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24):



nginx:

ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24



Enable output logging:



lua:

output alert_fast: alert.log





Step 3: Add Custom Rules

Snort detects intrusions using rules. Let’s create a rule to detect ping (ICMP) scans.



1.Open the rules file:



Bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules



2.Add the following rule to detect ICMP ping sweeps:



php:

alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

3.Save and exit.





Step 4: Run Snort in IDS Mode

Now, start Snort to monitor network traffic:



Bash:

sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0



-A console: Shows alerts on the terminal

-q: Runs in quiet mode

-c: Loads the Snort config



-i eth0 → Monitors traffic on eth0 (replace with your interface)





Step 5: Test Detection

To check if Snort detects suspicious activity, open another terminal and ping your machine:



Bash:

ping -c 3 192.168.1.10  # Replace with Snort’s IP



If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see Snort triggering an ICMP Ping Detected alert.





Step 6: Visualize Alerts (Optional)

For better analysis, you can:



i)Use Snorby, Base, or Kibana to visualize alerts.



ii)Install ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect and analyze Snort logs.
